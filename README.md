**Learn MERN stack development by building modern web apps using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js**

## What is this book about?
Facebook's React combined with industry-tested, server-side technologies, such as Node, Express, and MongoDB, enables you to develop and deploy robust real-world full-stack web apps. This updated second edition focuses on the latest versions and conventions of the technologies in this stack, along with their key features such as Hooks in React and async/await in JavaScript. The book also explores advanced topics such as implementing real-time bidding, a web-based classroom app, and data visualization in an expense tracking app.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Extend any MERN-based application to build a variety of applications
* Add real-time communication capabilities with Socket.IO
* Implement data visualization features for React applications using Victory
* Develop media streaming applications using MongoDB GridFS
* Improve SEO for your MERN apps by implementing server-side rendering with data
